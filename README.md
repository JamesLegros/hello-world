For anybody who cares,

My name is James Legros, I am a recent Electrical Engineering graduate from McGill University. I want to work on improving my programming skills through online tutorials (and general tomfoolery) and plan to keep track of my projects using GitHub. Programming is something I have always struggled with and I'm hoping to overcome my difficulties through practice, practice, practice.

Cool story bro.

Cheers,
James
